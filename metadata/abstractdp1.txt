This data package consists of two files to study long-term changes in communities across a range of systems (freshwater and terrestrial) and organism types (from short-lived (sub annual) to long-lived species) that are both primary producers and consumers. We compiled many datasets from publicly available archives (41 datasets are from 14 LTER sites). All datasets must have had a measure of species level abundance to calculate more derived community ecological metrics beyond species richness. These data can be used to study community dynamics over space and time.
