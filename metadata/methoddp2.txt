Both spatial and temporal heterogeneity were calculated using Bray-Curtis matrices. Bray-Curtis distance was used as it is the metric best suited for non-normal, multivariate data, and is less sensitive to changes in rare species than other distance measures (Anderson and Walsh 2013). For spatial heterogeneity, we calculated pairwise combinations of Bray-Curtis for all plots for each year and then averaged Bray-Curtis for each year. For temporal heterogeneity, we first took the mean abundance of each species across all replicates in a year. Then, we calculated Bray-Curtis between TimeX and TimeXplus1. Based on the mean abundance of each species across all replicates in a year we also calculated several typical measures of community structure.
To explore the drivers of temporal heterogeneity, we ran three mixed models using lmer() in the library(lme4). We assessed three linear mixed effects models to understand how spatial heterogeneity affects temporal heterogeneity. Random factors in all models represented the hierarchical structure of community type nested within a study nested within a long-term research site. Model 1 examined how spatial heterogeneity affects temporal heterogeneity. Model 2 also included the experimental predictors as fixed effects, while Model 3 included the biotic predictors as fixed effects. Additionally, temporal heterogeneity was also calculated at all timesteps available for each dataset.
